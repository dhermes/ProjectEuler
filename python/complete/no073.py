# Consider the fraction, n/d, where n and d are positive integers.
# If n < d and HCF(n,d)=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction.

# If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for d <= 8 in
# ascending order of size, we get:
# 1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 3/8, 2/5, 3/7, 1/2,
# 4/7, 3/5, 5/8, 2/3, 5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8

# It can be seen that there are 3 fractions between 1/3 and 1/2.

# How many fractions lie between 1/3 and 1/2 in the sorted set of
# reduced proper fractions for d <= 12,000?

# ALGO
# We simply seek 1/3 <= n/d <= 1/2 with (n, d) = 1
# This is equivalent to d/3 <= n <= d/2 or
# ceil(d/3) <= n <= floor(d/2)
# Note we'll never have conflicts since for d > 3,
# (n, d) = 1 implies n/d = 1/2 or n/d = 1/3 is
# impossible
