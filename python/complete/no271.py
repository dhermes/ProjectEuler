# P = f_1*...*f_k, where (f_i, f_j) = 1 if i != j
# This forces (f_i, P/f_i) = 1, hence there
# exist s, r that satisfy:
# s (P/f_i) + r f_i = 1
# Set e_i = s (P/f_i)
# Then e_i + 0 == 1 mod f_i
# and by definition e_i = s*(P/f_i) = s*0 mod f_j for all j != i

# For any x**3 == 1 mod n, we know (x, n) = 1 since x has finite
# order mod n. Thus by CRT, x = (x_1 mod f_1, ..., x_k mod f_k)
# for the coprime factors f_1*...*f_k = n. Given units as
# above, the sum X = e_1*x_1 + ... + e_k*x_k, necessarily has
# X mod f_i = 0*x_1 + ... + 1*x_i + ... + 0*x_k = x_i, hence X = x.

# Thus we need to find all cube roots in the factors dividing our n,
# all of which happen to be prime. We can then combine all possiblities
# to reconstruct X and then sum the X values
