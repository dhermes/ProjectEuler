# It can be verified that there are 23 positive integers less
# than 1000 that are divisible by at least four distinct primes
# less than 100.

# Find how many positive integers less than 10**16 are divisible
# by at least four distinct primes less than 100.


######################
# 2*3*5*7*11*13*17*19*23*29*31*37*41 = 304250263527210 < 10**16 but
# 304250263527210*43 = 13082761331670030 > 10**16

# Therefore we have at most 13 primes in our products

# Let N_{p_1,...,p_k} = {n | n < L, p_1, ... , p_k all divide n}
# One can easily show N_{p_1,...,p_k} = floor((L - 1)/(p_1*...*p_k))

# By PIE, our desired number is
# sum_{s in S} N_{s}
# where S is the set of all subsets of size 4 of the primes under 100

# Since N_{p1,...,p5} can arise as an intersection of (5 C 4) subsets of
# size 4, we need to subtract off (5 C 4) - 1 = (4 C 3)

# Similarly N_{p1,...,p6} can arise as an intersection of (6 C 4) subsets of
# size 4 of which we've already counted (5 C 4), so we need to add back
# in (6 C 4) - (5 C 4) = (5 C 3), etc.

# In general, we need to add/subtract back (index - 1 C 3)
