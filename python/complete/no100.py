# If a box contains twenty-one coloured discs, composed of fifteen blue
# discs and six red discs, and two discs were taken at random, it can be
# seen that the probability of taking two blue discs,
# P(BB) = (15/21)(14/20) = 1/2.

# The next such arrangement, for which there is exactly 50% chance of taking
# two blue discs at random, is a box containing eighty-five blue discs and
# thirty-five red discs.

# By finding the first arrangement to contain over 10**12 = 1,000,000,000,000
# discs in total, determine the number of blue discs that the box
# would contain.

# (b(b-1))/(T(T-1)) = (1/2) <==> 2(4b**2 - 4b) = 4T**2 - 4T
# <==> 2(2*b - 1)**2 - (2*T - 1)**2 = 1
# One can verify 2*x**2 - y**2 = 1 implies that x and y must be odd
# so all solutions of this are desired by us
