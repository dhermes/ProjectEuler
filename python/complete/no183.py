# M(N) = max_k (N/k)^k
# This is a discrete function, but its derivative has value
# f(k) = (N/k)^k, ln(f) = k ln(N) - k ln(k)
# f'/f = (ln(f))' = ln(N) - (ln(k) + k(1/k)) = ln(N/k) - 1
# f' > 0 iff ln(N/k) > 1 iff N/e > k
# So f increases towards N/e and similar decreases away from N/e
# Hence the max occurs either at the ceiling or floor of N/e

# Let k_star(N) be the function such that
# M(N) = P_max = f(k_star(N))

# Since the numerator of P_max is k_star**k_star, M(N) is only
# terminating if k_star is completely composed of 2's and 5's
# With this in mind, we defind k_reduced(N) to be the quotient
# that remains after all 2's and 5's are divided from k_star(N)
# Finally, D(N) = -N iff M(N) is terminating iff k_reduced(N) = 1
