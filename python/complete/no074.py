# Perhaps less well known is 169, in that it produces the longest chain of
# numbers that link back to 169; it turns out that there are only three
# such loops that exist:
#    169 --> 363601 --> 1454 --> 169
#    871 --> 45361 --> 871
#    872 --> 45362 --> 872
# It is not difficult to prove that EVERY starting number will eventually
# get stuck in a loop. For example,
#    69 --> 363600 --> 1454 --> 169 --> 363601 (--> 1454)
#    78 --> 45360 --> 871 --> 45361 (--> 871)
#    540 --> 145 (--> 145)

# Starting with 69 produces a chain of five non-repeating terms, but the
# longest non-repeating chain with a starting number below one million is
# sixty terms. How many chains, with a starting number below one million,
# contain exactly sixty non-repeating terms?
