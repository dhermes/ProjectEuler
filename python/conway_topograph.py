# Define a juncture J to be the four cells straddling a river
# We write J = (B, P, N, F) where B is the cell back,
# P is the cell "above" the middle and "N" the cell below
# (we often think of them as the positive/negative cells since
# the serve that purpose along the river)
# and F is the forward cell

# A cell has ( (x, y), val ) where (x,y) is the point on the
# lattice and val is the value it takes on the quadratic form

# RIVER:
# While traversing a river, if the value of F is positive,
# we turn right, if it is negative we turn left
# To turn left is: (B, P, N, F) -> (N, P, F, P + F)
# To turn right is: (B, P, N, F) -> (P, F, N, N + F)
# It can be thought of like this: the forward value must lie on
# the river (if a river exists and we are already on it), hence
# it must become the next positive cell in the juncture or the
# next negative cell

# POSITIVE ROOT:
# Define a positive root to be a point on the river where two
# positive valued cells meet, from which going forward all
# values must increase (since on the river, the value behing
# the two positives must be negative)
